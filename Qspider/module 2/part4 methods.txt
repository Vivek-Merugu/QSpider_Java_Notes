-We will discuss leapyear and sum of even number programs shortly


-Every Program consists of 2 things
1.Data------------>variables

2.OPerations------>Methods

Methods
--------
-A set of java statements which is enclosed within curly braces having a declartion
and which gets executed whenever we call it is called as method.

 Syntax:   AccessModifier NonAccessmodifier returntype methodname(Arguments)
               {

                      //Set of statements//
 
                }
 Accessmodifier NonAccessModifier returntype-------->Method Header
 
 Methodname(arguments)------------->Method signature

 {

   //set of stmts//------------------->Method implementation or method body 
  }

-Use of methods
----------------
-It is not recommended to write a buisness logic directly in class.
-So java says for such situation make use of methods.
For Ex:   (Not Recommended)
         class ATM
         {
           System.out.println("Withdrawl money");
          }
           (REcommended)
          class ATM
          {
             public static void Withdrawl()
             {
                  System.out.println("enter amount to withdrawl");
             }
           }

AccessModifier
---------------
-In java We have 4 access modifier---------->public,private,protected 
and default
public static void run()
private static void run()
protected static void run()
static void run()//default
Non Access Modifiers
--------------------
-In java We have 2 non access modifiers and they are
 static and non static
public static void run()//static
public  void run()//non static

Important Points
------------------
-Methods are used to performed some specific task.
-method will be consisting of method header and method signature
-method should be declare within scope of class
-within one class any number of methods we can write
-A method will be executed only when we call it.
-we can call a method with help of method signature
-A method can be called any number of times depending on our requirement
-One method cannot be written in another method,it can only be called
  Ex: public static void fly()
      {
           pubblic static void air()
          {
           }
        }
 -Above example is invalid 
-Ex2: public static void fly()
      {   air();
      }
      public static void air()
      {
      }
-Above is valid example.
-The main advantage of using method is reusability,i.e once we created method
 how many times we want we can execute it.

-program for practising
---------------------------
1.WAP for Book application to demonstrate usage of methods
2.WAP for car application to  demonstrate usage of methods
3.WAP for Account details of facebook user demonstrate usage of methods












METHODS WITH SOME INPUT
-----------------------
-A method can have any number of inputs in the form of arguments.

-Ex: public static void add()//method with zero argument Or input
     public static void add(int i)//method with integer argument 

-When we call any method with argument we have to pass that particular type
 of values.

-While passing arguments we have to make sure it will be as per sequence 
 define in method declaration.
Assignment
----------
class APP
{
   public static void registration(String name,String dob,
                                   int age,char gender,long contact,String city){
   //print the registeredinformation//
  }
   public statc void main(String args[])
       {
         //call registeration() 3 times for 3 different persons
       }
Expected output
----------------
Name : john
DOB  : 1-1-2001
Age  : 20
Gender: M
Contact:9898989898
City:Hyderabad

should print above info for 2 more people

METHOD WITH RETURN TYPE
------------------------
-If we want we can define a method with any specific return type.

for ex: public static int add()
        {
          //perform operation whatever we want//
             return integertypevalue;
         }

-Whenever we define a method with return type ,we are telling that my method
is going to return that particular type of data(value).

-It is mandatory to write return statement if we have a method with specific
 return type

return keyword
--------------
-It is used inside a method whenever we define a method with specific reurn type

-return keyword is used to take data and exit from method

-return keyword must be last statement in a method

-return keyword will not print the data.

-we cannot write more than one return statement in a method

Programs
----------
1.Create an APP  which includes the method as
 public static boolean login(String username,int password)
 {

   //Validate username and password//
}
WOrk: if username is Qspiders and password is 1234 return true
----- if anyother username is provided or password is provided return false


2.Create an APP which calculates 
  area of triangle
  area of circle
  area of rectangle
  area of square
-public static float areaOfTri(int breadth,int height)
 {
   //formula:  1/2 * breadth * height;
}
public static float areaOfCircle(int radius)
 {
    float radius=3.214f;
   //formula:  pie * radius * radius;
}
public static int areaOfRect(int breadth,int length)
 {
   //formula:  lenght * breadth;
}
public static int areaOfSquare(int side)
 {
   //formula:  side * side;
}
